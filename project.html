      <b>See '3 days in the life' of gorgeous green comet as it heads towards Earth </b>
      <p>A brilliant green comet has already produced some amazing imagery as it speeds toward its closest approach to Earth next month.

        Comet C/2022 E3 (ZTF) was discovered by astronomers at the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) at the Palomar Observatory in California in March 2022, when it was 399 million miles (643 million kilometers) from the sun, just inside the orbit of Jupiter. The comet's long orbital period (the amount of time it takes to complete one orbit of the sun) means that C/2022 E3 (ZTF) hasn't been seen from Earth in some 50,000 years.</p>

      <b>Flame-resistant variety of cotton could cut need for toxic retardants</b>
      <p>A form of cotton that is able to resist flames has been created by breeding parent strains that had no similar characteristics themselves. This could let us make fire-resistant fabrics without having to add toxic chemicals.

        The spread of fires through people’s homes often involve textiles catching alight, so many countries now require the fabrics used in furniture to have a certain level of resistance. Some workers and soldiers also need to wear flame-resistant clothing. There are synthetic fibres that are inherently resistant to fire, such as aramid, but they aren’t as comfortable or as sought-after as natural fibres like cotton.</p>

      <b>Magnetic tape: The surprisingly retro way big tech stores your data</b>        
      <p>WE HUMANS are hoarders. We love to amass information. And these days, with digital storage at our fingertips, we stockpile ludicrous amounts of the stuff, whether it is on hard drives at home or in the cloud. You might be surprised to discover, however, that a hefty chunk of the information we are holding on to today – from backups of your emails and photos to particle collision data from the Large Hadron Collider – is stored not on sleek hard drives, but on clunky plastic cartridges containing coiled ribbons of magnetic tape.

        That’s right, much of the world’s data is stored on tape – many thousands of kilometres of the stuff. While that may induce nostalgia for those who are old enough to remember making mixtapes and recording songs off the radio to cassette, tape technology has advanced enormously. So much so that researchers today are increasing its storage capacity at a rate that outstrips its rivals.
        
        Even tape has its limits, though. We are generating so much data that eventually it will be impossible to store everything. .</p>

  <h2>The green tech that could help Iceland become carbon neutral by 2040
    Iceland is developing a suite of technologies to help it reach carbon neutrality by 2040 – and its research could help other countries go green too</h2>
  <p>Inside a small, geodesic dome near Iceland’s Hellisheiði geothermal power station, water full of carbon dioxide is being pumped hundreds of metres down into the porous basalt. At least, I am assured it is: the water is so clear that the pipe looks empty when I peer through a viewing window at it. The CO2 will react with metals in the rock and turn into carbonates, locking it away safely for millennia.</p>

  <b>Amazon Axes ‘Smile’ Charity Program, Citing Limited Impact
    The move comes as Amazon is laying off 18,000 workers, but a company spokesman said the decision to end the AmazonSmile program was not a cost-cutting measure.</b>
  <p>Amazon is shutting down an in-house charity that gave customers the opportunity to direct a small amount of their purchases to a wide range of nonprofits, from large hospitals to modest horse farms, saying the impact “was often spread too thin.”

    The move was announced on the company’s blog on Wednesday. It comes as Amazon undertakes 18,000 layoffs — the largest retrenchment in its history — but a company spokesman said the decision was not a cost-cutting measure.
    
    Amazon introduced AmazonSmile a decade ago, as it sought to expand its then-middling Prime membership business, enabling customers to designate 0.5 percent of the price of eligible purchases to the charity of their choice. There was no additional cost for customers to donate.

  <b>Some fact about Technologies</b>
  <p>WITHOUT them, we would scarcely be able to comprehend the universe. Telescopes, whose majesty and complexity have been captured in these images by photographer Julian Abrams, are among astronomy’s most crucial instruments. They have opened our eyes to everything from the weather on distant planets to the workings of gravity.

    The shots shown here are from Everything Beautiful Is Far Away, a project by Abrams in collaboration with astronomer Richard Ellis at University College London. It pays homage to the major telescopes of the world and their impressive housings.
    
    The main image shows the Very Large Telescope in the Atacama desert, Chile, which is a complex of four instruments, each more than 8 metres across.</p>
